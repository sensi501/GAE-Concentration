What additional properties did you add to your models and why?
    - I added cards, available_cards, successfull_attempts, failed_attempts, 
      total_attempts, and move_history to the Game kind. To facilitate game
      record keeping and player move history.

    - I added successfull_attempts, total_attempts, and failed_attempts to the
      the Score kind to be more descriptive of players moves per game.
    
    
    - I added a new kind called Record to store players user keys, wins, 
      and loses to avoid using a long query that blocked the execution thread.
    
    - I added NumberOfResultsForm to facilitate a players entry of the number
      of results to be displayed on the score request endpoints.
    
    - I added RecordForm to specifically display a users name, wins, and loses
      for a more common and simplified leader board format and RecordForms to 
      display multiple RecordForm objects.


What were some of the trade-offs or struggles you faced when implementing 
the new game logic?
    - Trying to avoid making too many or too long datastore queries
    
    - Implementing an intuitive game history notation system
    
    - Finding ways to display user friendly output in the event of a mistake
